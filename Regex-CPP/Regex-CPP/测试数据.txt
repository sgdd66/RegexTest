Particle swarm optimization,PSO, is an evolutionary computation technique inspired in the
behavior of bird flocks. PSO algorithms were first introduced by Kennedy & Eberhart (1995)
for optimizing continuous nonlinear functions. The fundamentals of this metaheuristic
approach rely on researches where the movements of social creatures were simulated by
computers (Reeves, 1983; Reynolds, 1987; Heppner & Grenander, 1990). The research in PSO
algorithms has significantly grown in the last few years and a number of successful
applications concerning single and multi-objective optimization have been presented
(Kennedy& Eberhart, 2001; Coello et al., 2004). This popularity is partially due to the fact
that in the canonical PSO algorithm only a small number of parameters have to be tuned 
and also due to the easiness of implementation of the algorithms based on this technique.
Motivated by the success of PSO algorithms with continuous problems, researchers that deal
with discrete optimization problems have investigated ways to adapt the original proposal
to the discrete case. In many of those researches, the new approaches are illustrated with the
Traveling Salesman Problem, TSP, once it has been an important test ground for most
algorithmic ideas.
